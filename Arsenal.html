        <p>Arsenal is a first-person shooter (FPS) game created by the ROLVe Community based on the Arms Race game mode in the video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.Each round, players must get kills or assists and eventually reach 32 kills (or 16 kills if the game modes are not Standard, Gun Rotation, Competitive, Laser Tag, Automatics and Railgun Royale). The 31st kill is with the Golden Gun, and the 32nd (final) kill is with the Golden Knife. The golden knife is a gold version of the player's equipped melee, with the exception of the fisticuffs as they are already gold colored. Once the player with the Golden Knife gets a kill with it (no assists are allowed), the Golden Frying Pan kill sound effect from Team Fortress 2 plays, and the game ends. Both the golden gun and golden knife turn the player that was killed with them into a solid gold statue in the pose they were in when killed.</p>
